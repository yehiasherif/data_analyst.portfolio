## Portfolio Projects


### 📊 Featured Data Projects
*Here are some of the projects I’ve built to solve real-world data challenges:*

#### 1️⃣ [Freelancer Hours & Earnings Logger Visualization Dashboard]
* **Tools:** Power BI, Google Sheets.
* **Description:** [This project was designed specifically to meet your requirements for a simple, efficient, and visual way to track work hours and earnings. The solution consists of a Google Sheets backend for data entry and a Dynamic Visualization Dashboard that provides real-time insights into your freelance activities.].
* **Key Achievement:** [Centralized Logging: Easily log dates, project names, hours worked, and hourly rates.
Real-time Analytics: Automatically calculates:
Weekly Earnings: To track your short-term goals.
Total Hours: To monitor your overall productivity.
Total Earnings: A cumulative view of your income.
Visual Trends: Includes a line chart for "Total Earnings by Date" and a bar chart for "Total Hours by Project Name" to identify your most profitable projects.
Interactive Filters: Ability to filter the entire dashboard by specific project names.
Mobile-Friendly Design (Responsive).].
* **Conclusion:** [This dashboard provides a professional way to manage your freelance business with minimal effort, ensuring you stay on top of your productivity and income whether you are at your desk or using your mobile device.].

#### 2️⃣ [Box Office 1921-2016 Dashboard Visualization Analysis]
* **Tools:** Power BI.
* **Description:** [The dashboard is designed to provide a high-level view of the global film industry's financial performance over nearly a century, from 1921 to 2016. It aggregates data on movie performance, profitability, and critical success (measured by Oscar Wins) and segments this information across various dimensions.].
* * **Key Achievement:** [The primary goal of this analysis is to leverage the dashboard’s interactive filtering capabilities to uncover patterns, trends, and key insights into the film industry. Specifically, the analysis aims to:
Identify Market Leaders: Determine which countries and genres dominate in terms of revenue and profit.
Analyze Historical Trends: Quantify the scale of industry growth by comparing different time periods (e.g., the overall 95-year history versus the modern decade of 2000-2010).
Evaluate Filter Impacts: Understand how filtering by rating (Film Certificate) and Year affects the financial performance of various genres and countries.].

* **Conclusion:** [1. The Overwhelming Dominance of the United States
Box Office & Profit: The US is the undisputed global leader in both box office revenue and total profit. In the full dataset (1921-2016), the US contribution (over $164bn in Box Office) is far greater than the next country (UK at $31bn).
Oscar Wins: The US has earned nearly 80% of the total Oscar wins (544 out of 683), highlighting its dominant creative and critical position in the film industry.
2. The Explosive Growth of the Modern Era
Concentration of Revenue: The 11-year period from 2000-2010 alone generated $95 billion in box office revenue (Screenshot 3). When compared to the total revenue of $254 billion (Screenshot 2), this means over a third (37%) of the entire 95-year box office revenue (1921-2016) came from this single decade. This shows a massive increase in film consumption and ticket prices in the 21st century.
3. Genre Performance Shifts Over Time and Rating
Overall/Historic: Action is the highest-grossing genre historically (1921-2016).
Recent Trend (2000-2010, All Certs): In the modern era, Animation and Science Fiction surge to the top, suggesting a rise in blockbuster, high-budget, family-friendly, or effects-driven cinema.
Rating Impact (2000-2010, '15' Cert): When filtering only for mature films ('15' certificate, Screenshot 1), Action returns to the top, followed closely by Thriller and Comedy. This indicates that mature-rated action and suspense films remain highly profitable within their specific segment.
4. Correlation Between Box Office and Profit
The countries and genres that generate the highest Box Office revenue (e.g., US, Action) also overwhelmingly generate the highest Profit. This indicates that production and distribution costs, while substantial, do not drastically alter the relative ranking of market performance.].
